##PWP Milestone 1 Feedback
Great job on Milestone 1. Your code looks good, your project is set up correctly, and your purpose, audience and goals are well defined. Your Milestone 1 passes at [Tier IV](https://bootcamp-coders.cnm.edu/projects/personal/rubric/)

###To Do
Only one small thing: your final paragraph should be wrapped in with a &lt;p&gt; tag. Your code looks great overall - nice work!

## Milestone 4 Feedback
Jeff, I'm concerned you don't have enough time to complete this. Consider creating a very simple landing page. Take a look at samples I have up on bootcamp-coders. See me for guidance.
