		<h2>Persona</h2>
		<hr>
		<!-- This first section is the persona required for milestone 2 -->
		<p><strong>Name:  </strong>Naomi Pearson</p>
		<p><strong>Age:  </strong>60</p>
		<p></p>
		<p><strong>Profession:  </strong>Naomi is a middle-aged patent lawyer and president of a non-profit Albuquerque bicycle advocacy group.  She is looking at updating the eight-year old website for her adbvocacy group and using the update to generate more activitiy and discussion in the group.  Specifically, she want to provide information on biking events in New Mexico, bicycling related-construction projects, bicycle advocacy and safetly projects, and bicycling-related legal issues.  To generate more actiivty on the site, she wants to makde the site more interactive.  She is thinking of posting advocacy topics for discussion, such as how to get walkers, runners, and bicyclists to interact more safely on hiker-bikder trails or how can the city of Albuquerque make trails and roads safer for cyclists.  She has a grant for innovative ways to involve more people in the community in bicycling and bicycling advocacy.  The website will also include allowing people to become members or renew memberships as well as poll members on how they feel about particular advocacy issues or needs assessments.</p>
		<p></p>
		<p><strong>Technology:  </strong>Naomi is just short of being a power user.  Her technology is current or no more than two years old.  She uses a Windows desktop computer when at her office or home.  When she travels she uses a Windows laptop with a touch screen.  She is currently running Windows 10 on all her devices except for her smart phone, which is running the latest version of android.  She has experience using MS Office, email, web browswers, and using the web for research.  She has a strong science background with some coding experience in college.  Because she travels a lot, she uses a kindle but prefers reading real books when she can.  She accesses the web through her phone when she has to, but she prefers to use either her desktop or laptop computers to use the web when she can. </p>
		<p></p>
		<p><strong>Attitudes and Behaviors:  </strong> Naomi has a very busy workschedule between her busines and running the bicyle advocacy group.  She will not spend more than 5 minutes looking at anyone's porfolio and about 30 seconds reviewing a resume.  Naomi regularly uses social media and seeks potential candidates for web develpers through her contacts, local networking events and LinkedIn.</p>
		<p></p>
		<p><strong>Frustrations and Needs:  </strong>Naomi needs to hire a up and coming developer on a limited fixed budget as her orgnaization cannot afford to spend much on the website. So she needs someone with solid skills, willing to listen and learn, and able to work within her budget.  She hopes she can find someone she can work with who cares about what her organization is about.  She hopes to pay for maintenance of the completed project by offering free membership and event registration to the web developer she hires. Naomi's initial search indciates there are many local potential candidates to choose from.  She must find someone who will work within the given constraints listed above.  She is hoping to hire in the next two weeks with a start date of first week in January.</p>
		<p></p>
		<p><strong>Goals:  </strong>Naomi want to make sure she hires the right person as they may be with her bicycle advocacy group for a long time and a strong site with well-written discussions will help the group in their discussion with local and state government.  As she views web developer websites, she is asking herself, is this the right person for us?  Can he do the job?  Does he share our interest in supporting bicycling?  Does the coding have good documnetation so someone else can work on the site if needed?  But she cannot afford to wast time.  She needs to look at the site quickly and decide if this potential candidate has the skills and qualifications to warrent a call and a phone interview.</p>

		<h2>Use Case</h2>
		<hr>
		<p>After lunch today, Naomi has two hours to view websites before her next apointment.  She has looked at at my resume and noted that I have volunteered at two annual bike events each year for the past 5 years, volunteered as onair help at KUNM for a folk music show on Saturday mornings, and donated to support local NPR stations, PBS stations, and Popejoy Hall in addition to other local causes.  She checks out my profile on linked in and notes my former carreer as a university lecturer.  Being an older person changing fields, having worked as a teacher, and with philanthropic and biking interests, she thinks I may be a good candidate as develper early in my carreer to work on her group's website and put me on the list of potential candidates whose website she wants to check.</p>
		<p>She lands on the home page which includes links to my projects.  She sees I have only done a few projects.  Then she clicks on the link to the about me page.</p>
		<p>She looks at the about me page.  She notes my core skills and confirms the things from my resume and cover letter that peaked her interest.  She decides to include me on the list of phone interview candidates</p>
		<p></p>
